			<p> One thing I like to do in my free time is play video games. I find it as a great and safe way to have fun with friends, and it also helps relieve stress. My previous computer was already over five years old, with a processor from 2012 and a graphics card from 2014. The architecture the hardware was designed on was getting pretty dated, and the performance of my old computer was decreasing. As a way to reward myself for a good second semester of college, I decided I would build a new computer.</p>
			<p>Below are photos from during the build (which may or may not have occured at 4:00 AM). </p>
