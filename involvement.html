	<h1>Pi Lambda Phi Fraternity</h1>
	<p>In the Spring Semester of 2020, I joined the re-founding father class of Pi Lambda Phi Fraternity at the University of Cincinnati. I currently am the Web Administrator for the chapter website and the Vice President of Programming. Throughout my involvement with Pi Lambda Phi, I have gained valuable leadership skills being in charge of the programming comittee. I have also gained valuable teamwork skills through coordinating with my comittee to oversee events, as well as coordinating with others on the executive board to oversee general chapter operations.</p>

	<h1>Association for Computing Machinery at UC</h1>
	<p>I joined ACM@UC the Fall of my Sophomore year. I was looking for a way to boost my resume since I had no previous technical job experience when searching for my first Co-Op, and this club helped me do just that. As a member, I attend bi-weekly meetings that go-over various technical topics. These topics include technical interviews, could computing, version control, UI/UX design, full stack development, project design frameworks, etc.</p>
