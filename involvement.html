<h1>Association for Computing Machinery at UC</h1>

<p>I joined ACM@UC the Fall of my Sophomore year. I was looking for a way to boost my resume since I had no previous technical job experience when searching for my first co-op, and this club helped me do just that. I attend bi-weekly meetings that go-over various technical topics. These topics include technical interviews, could computing, version control, UI/UX design, full stack development, project design frameworks, etc.</p>

<h1>Pi Lambda Phi Fraternity</h1>

<p>In the Spring semester of 2020, I joined the re-founding father class of Pi Lambda Phi Fraternity at the University of Cincinnati. Upon initiation, I was selected to become recruitment week coordinator. This means that I am in charge of creating the schedule for rush week, keeping track of potential new memebers and their attendance to recruitment week events, and making sure that all of the brothers are putting forth the effort to invite potential new memebers to the recruitment week events. Over the two recruitment cycles, we were able to recruit 5 new members to increase our chapter size by 62.5%. Not only is this a good feat for a brand new chapter to get, but we were also founded right before the COVID-19 pandemic started and the campus population was almost entirely sent home.</p>
