			<h1>Rotation #2 - ECSS Co-Op - University of Cincinnati</h1>
			<p> On my second rotation with ECSS, I was given additional responsibilities besides support. One of my main responsibilities besides support was to disassemble old A/V racks in Rieveschl Hall since the classrooms were being rennovated into office spaces. After Thanksgiving break we had a big project in Rieveschl 502 to redo the A/V rack in the room as it was unorganized and some of the equipment was outdated. I was in charge of pulling the old equipment out and modifying the design plans to use equipment we had in the storage room. We didn't have any budget for the room besides a new network switch, so modifying the existing plans to fit our needs on a low budget was a challenge. However, I was able to successfully complete the build with the limited budget and hardware constraints.</p>
			<h1>Rotation #1 - ECSS Co-Op - University of Cincinnati</h1>
			<p>This was my first-ever leap into the IT world. I had 3 days of training before the start of the semester when the calls/tickets started rolling in. My main responsibility was to provide technical support to professors using the classroom technology. I supported everything from the Windows OS on the PC, the classroom speakers, projectors, screens, and anything inside the A/V rack. Throughout the course of the semester I was able to learn in-depth how all of the equipment in the rack works as well as learn more about how they all connect to each other. This really peaked my interest in how devices communicate with one another and the infrastructure of networks.</p>
