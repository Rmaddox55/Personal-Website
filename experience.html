			<h1>Rotation #3 - IT@UC Electronic Classroom Support Services Co-Op - University of Cincinnati</h1>
			<p>On my third Co-Op rotation, I got to lead an equipment upgrade project in over 100 classrooms. Due to the university having more online and hybrid classes due to covid, many professors needed to use video conferencing such as Zoom, Teams, or Webex. Most of our classrooms have ceiling mounted cameras, and the feed from the camera needs to get to the classroom PCs for the professors to use. We accomplish this by using a usb-bridge device, which converts HDMI video signal from the camera into a USB video signal that plugs into the classroom PC. Our department was experiencing many issues with the old models, as they overheated and died very often. So when time for the upgrade came, I was in charge of coming up with the procedure for the swap, swapping the equipment, making all necessary wiring changes for the audio & serial control, configuring the microphone input levels on the device, and configuring network settings on the device. I was able to successfully complete this upgrade project of over 100 classrooms throughout the course of the semester.</p>
			<h1>Rotation #2 - IT@UC Electronic Classroom Support Services Co-Op - University of Cincinnati</h1>
			<p> On my second rotation with ECSS, I was given additional responsibilities besides support. One of my main responsibilities besides support was to disassemble old A/V racks in Rieveschl Hall since the classrooms were being rennovated into office spaces. I also had to coordinate with a co-worker to keep record of the old serial numbers so we could surplus the old equipment. My department also had a big project in Rieveschl 502 after Thanksgiving. We were to tear out and rebuild the A/V rack in the room as it was unorganized and some of the equipment was outdated. I was tasked to work as a team and pull the old equipment out and modify the wiring diagram to use make spare equipment we had laying around compatible in the new build. We didn't have any budget for the room besides a new Cisco Catalyst network switch, so modifying the existing plans to fit our needs on a low budget was a challenge. However, my co-worker and I were able to work as a team to successfully complete the build with the limited budget and hardware constraints.</p>
			<h1>Rotation #1 - IT@UC Electronic Classroom Support Services Co-Op - University of Cincinnati</h1>
			<p>This was my first-ever leap into the IT world. I had 3 days of training before the start of the semester when the calls/tickets started rolling in. My main responsibility was to provide technical support to professors using the classroom A/V equipment. I had to quickly troubleshoot and resolve issues on everything from the Windows OS issues, sound problems, projector issues, projector screen relays, and video switching issues. Throughout the course of the semester I was able to learn in-depth how all of the equipment in the A/V rack works as well as learn more about how they all connect to each other. This really peaked my interest in how devices communicate with one another and the infrastructure of networks.</p>
