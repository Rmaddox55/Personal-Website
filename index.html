			<h1 class="main_h1">Welcome To My Personal Website!</h1>
			<p>I am Computer Engineering student at the University of Cincinnati in the Co-Op Class of 2023. I have a passion for hardware design, software engineering, and web development. </p>
			<p><span class="main_bold">I am currently searching for a Spring 2020 Co-Op position.</span> To view the projects I have worked on please visit the <a href="projects.html" class="main_a">projects</a> page of my website or go to my Github profile through the link in the footer.</p>
			<p>My passion was found when I was in the 6th grade. Over Spring Break I built my first computer to replace my aging laptop at the time. My laptop was struggling to keep up with the games I wanted to play, mainly Team Fortress 2, so I had decided that I needed to build my own computer after I had saved up enough money from working at my family business over the summer. I was amazed at how easy it was to assemble and wanted to try other things related to technology.</p>
			<p>In my junior year of high school, I signed up to take a course in C++ Programming. This course introduced me to object oriented programming and taught me things like how to use a compiler, functions, data types, I/O, if/else statements, loops, case structures, and how to debug my code. I loved this class and found a new passion in coding.</p>
			<p>The next year I took AP Computer Science A to learn Java and earned a passing score on the AP Exam at the end of the year. I also took courses to learn Visual Basic for Applications, Python, and HTML/CSS. In my webpage design course we just barely started javascript by the end of the school year and that's when I learned that the possibilites of what we can create are endless. I look forward to joining the tech industry and seeing what mankind can accomplish together.</p>
