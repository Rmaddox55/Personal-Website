			<h1 class="main_h1">Welcome To My Personal Website!</h1>
			<p>I am a Computer Engineering student at the University of Cincinnati in the Co-Op Class of 2023. I have a passion for software engineering, information technology, and web development. </p>
			
			<p><span class="main_bold">I am currently searching for a Fall 2020 Co-Op position.</span> To view my work experience and relevent experience please view the <a href="documents/resume.pdf" class="main_a">Résumé</a> page of my website.</p>
			
			<p>I have previously had one Co-Op rotation with Electronic Classroom Support Services (ECSS) at the University of Cincinnati during the Spring Semester of 2020. During my Co-Op, I was responsible for reporting to classrooms promptly to provide assistance with the A/V systems in the classrooms. These reports came to me via phone calls, email, or tickets through TeamDynamix. When I arrived at the classroom, I had to speak with reporter so I could figure out what they were having an issue with. I then had to use critical-thinking and troubleshooting skills to quickly deploy a fix that would last atleast for the remainder of the class so the professor could resume with their lecture uninterrupted. I would then document this incident using TeamDynamix, our ticketing system. I would then come back to the classroom when it was open and verify that all of the A/V equipment was still fully functional.</p>
			
			<p>I throughly enjoyed my time with ECSS and even planned on returning as a part-time student worker over the Summer and again as a Co-Op during the Fall 2020 Semester. However, due to COVID-19 I was unable to do so.
			I was able to improve greatly upon my customer service, troubleshooting, and critical-thinking skills during my Co-Op. </p>
			
			<p>Since my Co-Op, I have returned to a full-time course load (15 credit-hours) while also working 3 days a week (~25 hours) at my father's landscaping business. My favorite class this Summer semester has been Data Structures. In this class, we are learning about data is stored differently and when to use certain structures. In this class, I have built Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Binary Trees, Heaps, Priority Queues, and Hash Tables from scratch using C++ classes.</p>
