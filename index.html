				<h1>Hi, I'm Reagan!</h1>
				<p>
					I am currently a 4th year Computer Engineering student at the University of Cincinnati and I will be graduating in May of 2023. I am currently seeking a Co-Op position for my final two Co-Op rotations, which are for the Spring 2022 & Summer 2022 semesters.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have over 1.5 years of IT experience in a support role with IT@UC Electronic Classroom Support Services. For the Fall 2021 semester, I am currently taking a full-time course load, working part-time with IT@UC ECSS, and studying for my CCNA certification. I expect to have my CCNA by the end of November 2021.
				</p>
				<p>
					My goal upon graduation is to become a Network Engineer, and for my mid-to-late career I want to get into IT management.
