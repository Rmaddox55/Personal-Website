			<p>The objective of this team project was to build a robot prototype that could follow a black line on the ground, navigate over obstacles, and picking up soda cans and determine where to go set them down based off how much they weighed. All of this had to be done using the given Lego Mindstorms EV3 robot kit. I led the team and also was the main programmer. My main duties included organizing times for the team to meet that worked with everybody's schedules and also using the built in Lego Mindstorms EV3 Software (based on LABVIEW) to create the programs that would give the robot directions.</p>
